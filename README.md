# MyReads App

A book tracking application that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading or want to read.

This is the first project in [Udacity's React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) concluding the "React Fundamentals" portion of the program.

This application was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Note, while this application is implemented using React, it is purposely not using Redux, as this is a pre-Redux project, i.e. assigned prior to the Redux section of the program.

## Specification

The main page of the application displays a "Bookcase" with three "bookshelves" (i.e. categories) each containing a number of books. The bookshelves are:

* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf to place that book on. When you select a different shelf, the book moves to that shelf. The default value for the bookshelf control shall be the current shelf the book is on.

The main page has a link toÂ a search page that allows you to find more books to add to your Bookcase.

The search page has a text input that is used to enter a search query string. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match the search query are displayed on the page. Each book displayed has a control that lets you add the book to your Bookcase on the bookshelf you choose.

When a book is on a bookshelf, it should have the same state on both the main page and the search page.

The search page also has a link back to the main page.
When you navigate back to the main page from the search page, you should see all of the book selections you made on the search page in your bookcase.


## Backend Server API

The [`Books API`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the following methods:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query, maxResults)
```

* query: `<String>`
* maxResults: `<Integer>` Due to the nature of the backend server, search results are capped at 20, even if this is set higher.
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

### Note
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.
